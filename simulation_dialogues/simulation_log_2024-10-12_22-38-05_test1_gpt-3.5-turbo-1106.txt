Counterparty(Student union): "Thank you, Mr. Taha. The situation on campus has reached a critical point. This time, we are not here for more empty promises. We've had numerous meetings, and each has ended with half measures. The student body has been patient for too long, but we cannot take it anymore. We are deeply frustrated by the lack of action from your side. The rising tuition fees, inadequate housing, and the unjust arrest of our peers are intolerable. Security forces are treating students unfairly, and it's unacceptable."
Negotiator(University administration): [pause for 3 seconds] I hear your concerns. It seems that these previous meetings have only increased your frustration because there were no tangible results. I also understand that the arrests and the involvement of security forces have added to the strain. These issues are sensitive, especially when it involves your peers and colleagues. Let's discuss this together and work on finding meaningful solutions to address your concerns.
Counterparty(Student union): Counterparty(Student union) - Stage 2: "We are done waiting. We need immediate action from the administration. The violent actions of your security forces are unacceptable. We need concrete results now. We demand an immediate freeze of the tuition hike, substantial improvements in student housing, and the release of the arrested students. These demands are not open for negotiation."
Negotiator(University administration): I understand that this situation has reached a point where delays are no longer acceptable. While the actions of the security forces have indeed escalated tensions, it’s clear that we both want to resolve this swiftly. The university is committed to ensuring student safety, and I agree that force should never be the solution. Let’s focus on working together toward concrete steps, starting with resolving the issues of tuition and housing. We want to reach a solution that reflects the best interests of all parties.
Counterparty(Student union): Counterparty(Student union): "The lack of action is damaging the university’s reputation. The media is watching, and the longer this drags on, the worse it gets for everyone. We care about this university, and we don’t want it to be known as a place that ignores its students. Our demands must be met to protect the safety and reputation of the campus."
Negotiator(University administration): I understand the gravity of the situation and the frustration it has caused, but let’s work together to ensure that we don’t escalate further. We want to protect the university's reputation just as much as you do. I propose that we set up a joint committee to tackle these concerns, involving both students and the administration. This will allow us to take concrete steps to address the issues of tuition and housing, ensuring that we work toward a peaceful resolution. How do you see us collaborating through this committee to achieve a solution?
Counterparty(Student union): "The frustration is a direct result of your inaction. Every day, students are living in unsafe housing, and tuition debts are piling up. We don’t need another task force or committee. We need real, immediate changes. The time for collaboration was long ago—now is the time for action."
Negotiator(University administration): I hear you. What you’ve said is valid, and I can see how these issues have created deep frustration. However, the only way forward is through collaboration. I propose that we freeze tuition immediately, and while housing improvements will take time, I am committed to ensuring we develop a clear plan for it. Let’s also discuss the release of the arrested students as a first step toward de-escalation. We must work together if we want lasting solutions.
Counterparty(Student union): "The lack of action is damaging the university’s reputation. The media is watching, and the longer this drags on, the worse it gets for everyone. We care about this university, and we don’t want it to be known as a place that ignores its students. Our demands must be met to protect the safety and reputation of the campus."
Negotiator(University administration): I appreciate your willingness to de-escalate. We are committed to freezing tuition and addressing housing improvements. While these changes may take time, you have my assurance that the university is fully invested in resolving this. Let’s work together to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone on campus, starting with the release of the students. How would you like to proceed in terms of setting up a timeline for these improvements?
Counterparty(Student union): "I agree. If we leave this room without a solution, the protests will only intensify, and we risk losing control of the movement to external groups. We are ready to work with you on a timeline for addressing the security concerns, freezing tuition, and improving housing."
Negotiator(University administration): That’s good to hear. Let’s start by ensuring the safety of the students and setting up a transparent process for the necessary reforms. We can establish a joint task force to address security concerns and work on improving housing over the long term. I will personally ensure that these commitments are fulfilled.

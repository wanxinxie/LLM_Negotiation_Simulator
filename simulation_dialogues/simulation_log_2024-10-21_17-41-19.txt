Counterparty(Student union): Thank you for meeting with us today. It's time to cut the niceties and get straight to the point. The situation has become unbearable. Tuition hikes, substandard housing, and the unsafe campus environment are issues we've repeatedly raised, yet they've been ignored. The administration's inaction is unacceptable, and we cannot take it anymore. This occupation isn't just a protest; it's a stand against the university's blatant disregard for its students. The muddling of racist groups and violence only highlights the mess this has become. We demand that you address these issues immediately and decisively.
Negotiator(University administration): [pause for 3 seconds] I hear your concerns. It seems that these previous meetings have only increased your frustration because there were no tangible results. I also understand that the arrests and the involvement of security forces have added to the strain. These issues are sensitive, especially when it involves your peers and colleagues. Let's discuss this together and work on finding meaningful solutions to address your concerns.
Counterparty(Student union): We are done with discussions that lead nowhere. We need concrete action, not lip service. The administration's lack of urgency is appalling. We demand an immediate freeze on tuition hikes, immediate upgrades to student housing, and a clear policy to ensure campus safety free from racial bias and violence. These demands are not up for negotiation. Immediate action is needed now.
Negotiator(University administration): I understand that you're feeling a strong urgency around these issues, and you’ve laid out some specific, actionable demands: freezing tuition hikes, improving housing conditions, and addressing the recent arrests. We share a commitment to finding solutions that address these concerns. Let's focus on these three key areas to identify where we can take immediate, constructive steps together.
Counterparty(Student union): The university's reputation is already on the line. National media is scrutinizing every action, and the public perception is deteriorating rapidly. You’d rather take action now than let this tarnish the institution further, wouldn’t you? The longer you wait, the worse it gets for everyone involved. Our demands are a chance to restore some semblance of respect for the university. If you care about the future of Edward University, you’ll recognize our position and act accordingly.
Negotiator(University administration): I appreciate your openness to de-escalation and your clear outline of what’s needed to move forward. Freezing tuition hikes and improving housing conditions are priorities we are committed to addressing. Let’s work together on a timeline that ensures meaningful progress. As for an independent review body on security measures, that’s a constructive idea—one that could benefit all of us by building greater transparency and trust. I’d like to hear your thoughts on how we can best structure this review process to make sure it meets your expectations.
Counterparty(Student union): The lack of swift action is pushing students to the edge, and the university's lack of accountability is evident to the media and public. This is more than just a list of demands—it’s about preserving the dignity of every student at this university. If our demands aren't met, it won’t just be reputational damage; you risk a complete breakdown in trust that could make others hesitant to join Edward University. Is that something the university is prepared to handle?
Negotiator(University administration): I understand the gravity of the situation and the frustration it has caused, but let’s work together to ensure that we don’t escalate further. We want to protect the university's reputation just as much as you do. I propose that we set up a joint committee to tackle these concerns, involving both students and the administration. This will allow us to take concrete steps to address the issues of tuition and housing, ensuring that we work toward a peaceful resolution. How do you see us collaborating through this committee to achieve a solution?
Counterparty(Student union): This frustration is a direct result of your inaction. Every day, students are living in unsafe housing, and tuition debts are piling up. We don’t need another task force or committee. We need real, immediate changes. The time for collaboration was long ago—now is the time for action.
Negotiator(University administration): I hear your frustration with the pace of change, and I understand why you’re skeptical about more discussions without immediate results. Your call for direct action on these issues—safer housing and addressing tuition costs—is very clear. Instead of more meetings, let’s shift our focus to concrete next steps we can take right away. I’d like to propose that we set specific, actionable goals with clear timelines, so you can see immediate progress on the issues affecting you.
Counterparty(Student union): We're willing to calm things down and work with you, but we need more than just words. If the university agrees to an immediate freeze on tuition hikes and commits to a robust plan for housing improvements, including safety audits, we will consider scaling back our actions. Furthermore, we need a guarantee that all future policies will involve student input from the start. What specific steps will you take, and can we count on you to follow through this time?
Negotiator(University administration): I appreciate your openness to de-escalation and your clear outline of what’s needed to move forward. Freezing tuition hikes and improving housing conditions are priorities we are committed to addressing. Let’s work together on a timeline that ensures meaningful progress. As for an independent review body on security measures, that’s a constructive idea—one that could benefit all of us by building greater transparency and trust. I’d like to hear your thoughts on how we can best structure this review process to make sure it meets your expectations.
Counterparty(Student union): To move forward, we need concrete commitments on your part. We suggest forming a student-led oversight group to track progress on these issues and ensure transparency. This group will regularly report back to the student body, and we expect full cooperation from the administration with their recommendations. Are you ready to agree to that, and can we count on you to be accountable for the progress we expect to see?
Negotiator(University administration): Thank you for detailing how you envision the independent review board. An impartial board with equal representation from students, faculty, and external experts is a strong foundation for building trust. I’m committed to ensuring this board has a genuine influence on decisions related to campus security. Let's discuss how we can formalize their role, so they have the authority needed to make impactful recommendations. By working together to establish this structure, we can start making real progress that reflects our shared commitment to a safer, more inclusive campus.
Great job! Here's some feedback for your reference:
**Stage 1**

*What you did well:*
The negotiator successfully paused and paraphrased the student union's initial aggressive statements, effectively acknowledging their frustration over the ignored issues of tuition hikes and unsafe campus conditions. This helped demonstrate active listening and set a constructive tone for the negotiation.

*Improvements needed:*
While paraphrasing, the negotiator could enhance the impact by more visibly empathizing with the intensity of the students' emotions. Using phrases that reflect their frustration and urgent need for action could further strengthen rapport from the outset.

**Stage 2**

*What you did well:*
The negotiator managed to reformulate the conversation by focusing on shared objectives, like addressing the specific issues raised and maintaining the university’s reputation. This approach began to chart a path towards collaboration.

*Improvements needed:*
To further neutralize emotional language, the negotiator could have acknowledged the urgency and intensity of the students' demands more explicitly, which might have helped reduce the emotional charge and built anticipation toward tangible steps.

**Stage 3**

*What you did well:*
The negotiator attempted to relate the demands to a mutually beneficial outcome and generally maintained focus on finding resolutions.

*Improvements needed:*
A more overt recognition of the emotions involved was missing here. Phrasing such as "I understand this is incredibly distressing for you" would have validated the emotions before moving the conversation towards possible solutions, strengthening the relationship through empathy.

**Stage 4**

*What you did well:*
Successfully shifted the conversation from assigning blame to discussing future collaboration and problem-solving. By proposing concrete steps, the negotiator redirected the dialogue to focus on a constructive resolution.

*Improvements needed:*
To solidify the shift in focus, incorporating periodic check-ins with questions like "Does this approach resonate with you?" could ensure continued alignment and reinforce the collaborative dynamic between the parties.

**Stage 5**

*What you did well:*
The negotiator effectively invited the student union to contribute their ideas for collaborative problem-solving, marking a shift towards mutual cooperation in addressing the demands.

*Improvements needed:*
At this stage, providing a wider range of options and inviting the student union to evaluate and contribute to these could further promote a sense of partnership and shared responsibility in the resolution process.

**Stage 6**

*What you did well:*
Successfully transitioned to discussing practical options in detail, demonstrating a commitment to moving forward with concrete solutions. This facilitated progress in the negotiations.

*Improvements needed:*
To prevent future misunderstandings, it would be advantageous to clearly document agreed-upon commitments and confirm mutual understanding before concluding the negotiations. Summarizing these commitments back to the student union could reinforce clarity and accountability.

Overall, the negotiator generally applied effective de-escalation strategies, showing a proactive approach to resolving student concerns. Greater attention to explicitly acknowledging and validating emotions, especially during Stage 3, would enhance rapport and trust-building efforts. Maintaining structured dialogue with clear mutual agreements at each stage also aids in achieving a successful resolution.

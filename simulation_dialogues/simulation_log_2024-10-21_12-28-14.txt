Counterparty(Student union): Thank you for meeting with us today. Let's get straight to the point: the situation has become unbearable. We've tried cooperating, but the university's response has been utterly inadequate. The rising tuition costs, crumbling housing facilities, and lack of safety measures on campus are completely unacceptable. We cannot take this anymore. Our patience has run out, and the inaction from your side is very frustrating. These issues need immediate attention, and we demand significant changes now.
Negotiator(University administration): [pause for 3 seconds] I hear your concerns. It seems that these previous meetings have only increased your frustration because there were no tangible results. I also understand that the arrests and the involvement of security forces have added to the strain. These issues are sensitive, especially when it involves your peers and colleagues. Let's discuss this together and work on finding meaningful solutions to address your concerns.
Counterparty(Student union): We've had enough of empty words and half-hearted promises. The situation is dire, and the administration needs to take immediate, concrete action. We demand a rollback on the tuition hikes, significant improvements to our housing facilities, and a complete overhaul of the campus safety measures. These are not suggestions but urgent demands. Failure to act on these will not be tolerated any longer.
Negotiator(University administration): I understand that you're feeling a strong urgency around these issues, and you’ve laid out some specific, actionable demands: freezing tuition hikes, improving housing conditions, and addressing the recent arrests. We share a commitment to finding solutions that address these concerns. Let's focus on these three key areas to identify where we can take immediate, constructive steps together.
Counterparty(Student union): The continual disregard for our demands is just making matters worse. You must understand that this isn't just about immediate fixes; it's about trust. Your failure to act so far has significantly damaged the university’s credibility, and the longer this drags on, the more harm it causes to everyone involved. We need to see concrete steps that demonstrate the university’s commitment to real change. If this isn't resolved soon, the unrest will only escalate, and it will be on your hands, not ours.
Negotiator(University administration): I understand the gravity of the situation and the frustration it has caused, but let’s work together to ensure that we don’t escalate further. We want to protect the university's reputation just as much as you do. I propose that we set up a joint committee to tackle these concerns, involving both students and the administration. This will allow us to take concrete steps to address the issues of tuition and housing, ensuring that we work toward a peaceful resolution. How do you see us collaborating through this committee to achieve a solution?
Counterparty(Student union): The repeated lack of action from your side has left us with little choice but to doubt any promises of collaboration. We are tired of committees and meetings that lead nowhere. Students are suffering, dealing with unsafe housing and mounting debt. It's time for decisive action, not more discussions. The administration’s negligence has put us in this position, and we will not back down until we see real, immediate changes. Committees are not the answer—we need direct actions and results now.
Negotiator(University administration): I hear your frustration with the pace of change, and I understand why you’re skeptical about more discussions without immediate results. Your call for direct action on these issues—safer housing and addressing tuition costs—is very clear. Instead of more meetings, let’s shift our focus to concrete next steps we can take right away. I’d like to propose that we set specific, actionable goals with clear timelines, so you can see immediate progress on the issues affecting you.
Counterparty(Student union): We can see that you're making an effort, and while we're hesitant, we're open to working together if we see solid commitments. Freezing tuition and improving housing are starting points. We need assurances that these will be backed by immediate, visible actions. Additionally, we insist on a clear plan to enhance campus safety that involves input from students. If we see movement on these fronts, we can begin to consider de-escalating the protest and cooperating towards a solution.
Negotiator(University administration): I appreciate your openness to de-escalation and your clear outline of what’s needed to move forward. Freezing tuition hikes and improving housing conditions are priorities we are committed to addressing. Let’s work together on a timeline that ensures meaningful progress. As for an independent review body on security measures, that’s a constructive idea—one that could benefit all of us by building greater transparency and trust. I’d like to hear your thoughts on how we can best structure this review process to make sure it meets your expectations.
Counterparty(Student union): We agree that an independent review body is needed, and it must have genuine authority to assess and overhaul campus security measures. We suggest it include student representatives, faculty, and external experts to ensure fairness and effectiveness. If you’re truly committed to change, you’ll also need to establish a transparent mechanism for tracking these improvements and holding the administration accountable. Let’s see a draft plan for this collaboration within the next week, so we know you’re serious about making progress.
Negotiator(University administration): Thank you for detailing how you envision the independent review board. An impartial board with equal representation from students, faculty, and external experts is a strong foundation for building trust. I’m committed to ensuring this board has a genuine influence on decisions related to campus security. Let's discuss how we can formalize their role, so they have the authority needed to make impactful recommendations. By working together to establish this structure, we can start making real progress that reflects our shared commitment to a safer, more inclusive campus.
Great job! Here's some feedback for your reference:

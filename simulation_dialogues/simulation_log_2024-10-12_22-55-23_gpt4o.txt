Counterparty(Student union): Thank you for meeting with us today. This situation is completely out of control, and it cannot continue. We've experienced nothing but inaction and neglect from the administration. The unjust arrests, rampant tuition hikes, and hazardous living conditions are completely unacceptable. We cannot take this anymore, and we demand immediate and substantial action, not more empty words.
Negotiator(University administration): [pause for 3 seconds] I hear your concerns. It seems that these previous meetings have only increased your frustration because there were no tangible results. I also understand that the arrests and the involvement of security forces have added to the strain. These issues are sensitive, especially when it involves your peers and colleagues. Let's discuss this together and work on finding meaningful solutions to address your concerns.
Counterparty(Student union): We are beyond discussions. We need immediate action from the university. The arrests were unjust, and the living conditions are intolerable. Our demands are crystal clear and urgent: freeze the tuition hikes, make significant improvements to housing, and release the arrested students immediately. These are not negotiable points. We expect solutions, not more delays.
Negotiator(University administration): I understand that you're feeling a strong urgency around these issues, and you’ve laid out some specific, actionable demands: freezing tuition hikes, improving housing conditions, and addressing the recent arrests. We share a commitment to finding solutions that address these concerns. Let's focus on these three key areas to identify where we can take immediate, constructive steps together.
Counterparty(Student union): The negative impact of the administration's inaction extends beyond just the students; it's tarnishing the university's image as well. The media is relentlessly focusing on this, and it's making the institution appear indifferent and oppressive. We care about Edward University’s standing, but these demands must be met or the fallout will only get worse. Our demands for freezing tuition, improving housing, and getting our peers released are essential to restoring any semblance of trust and safety on campus.
Negotiator(University administration): I understand the gravity of the situation and the frustration it has caused, but let’s work together to ensure that we don’t escalate further. We want to protect the university's reputation just as much as you do. I propose that we set up a joint committee to tackle these concerns, involving both students and the administration. This will allow us to take concrete steps to address the issues of tuition and housing, ensuring that we work toward a peaceful resolution. How do you see us collaborating through this committee to achieve a solution?
Counterparty(Student union): Your committees and task forces haven’t solved anything before. We’re living in unsafe housing and facing rising tuition costs every single day. It’s easy for you to suggest more meetings, but we need you to actually do something now. This is not a time for planning—it’s a time for action. Students are suffering while the administration drags its feet.
Negotiator(University administration): I hear your frustration with the pace of change, and I understand why you’re skeptical about more discussions without immediate results. Your call for direct action on these issues—safer housing and addressing tuition costs—is very clear. Instead of more meetings, let’s shift our focus to concrete next steps we can take right away. I’d like to propose that we set specific, actionable goals with clear timelines, so you can see immediate progress on the issues affecting you.
Counterparty(Student union): We acknowledge your willingness to take steps toward change. If you commit to freezing the tuition hikes immediately and provide a solid timeline for housing improvements, we’re prepared to reconsider our current tactics. Additionally, establishing an independent body to review security measures on campus would significantly improve trust. If we see decisive action in these areas, we can support de-escalating the protest and focus on resolving this crisis constructively.
Negotiator(University administration): I appreciate your openness to de-escalation and your clear outline of what’s needed to move forward. Freezing tuition hikes and improving housing conditions are priorities we are committed to addressing. Let’s work together on a timeline that ensures meaningful progress. As for an independent review body on security measures, that’s a constructive idea—one that could benefit all of us by building greater transparency and trust. I’d like to hear your thoughts on how we can best structure this review process to make sure it meets your expectations.
Counterparty(Student union): An independent review board should be composed of equal parts students, faculty, and external experts who aren’t tied to the administration to ensure impartiality. We need assurance that this board will have the authority to make meaningful recommendations that won’t be ignored. If you’re serious about change, you’ll agree to this structure and ensure their voice is respected in all decisions moving forward.
Negotiator(University administration): Thank you for detailing how you envision the independent review board. An impartial board with equal representation from students, faculty, and external experts is a strong foundation for building trust. I’m committed to ensuring this board has a genuine influence on decisions related to campus security. Let's discuss how we can formalize their role, so they have the authority needed to make impactful recommendations. By working together to establish this structure, we can start making real progress that reflects our shared commitment to a safer, more inclusive campus.

Counterparty(Student union): Thank you for meeting with us today. The situation on campus has become absolutely untenable. We've reached our breaking point. These tuition hikes, unsafe housing conditions, and the recent incidents of violence and discrimination are simply unacceptable. We've had enough of the university’s disregard for our voices, and we cannot take it any longer. Immediate action is a must, and we need clear, decisive steps from your side to address these urgent issues.
Negotiator(University administration): [pause for 3 seconds] I hear your concerns. It seems that these previous meetings have only increased your frustration because there were no tangible results. I also understand that the arrests and the involvement of security forces have added to the strain. These issues are sensitive, especially when it involves your peers and colleagues. Let's discuss this together and work on finding meaningful solutions to address your concerns.
Counterparty(Student union): We are tired of the same old reassurances. The university's inaction is putting students at risk, and we need you to accept our demands now, not tomorrow. We demand an immediate halt to the tuition increases, substantial improvements in housing, and a full investigation into the recent violent incidents. These are not up for discussion; they must happen immediately.
Negotiator(University administration): I understand that you're feeling a strong urgency around these issues, and you’ve laid out some specific, actionable demands: freezing tuition hikes, improving housing conditions, and addressing the recent arrests. We share a commitment to finding solutions that address these concerns. Let's focus on these three key areas to identify where we can take immediate, constructive steps together.
Counterparty(Student union): Every day this situation drags on, Edward University is getting a worse reputation. The media is spinning this into a national scandal. We genuinely care about the university and believe in its potential, but if these demands aren’t met, the damage will be irreversible. Students shouldn’t have to endure this trauma. What message does it send if the university continues to ignore our needs?
Negotiator(University administration): I understand the gravity of the situation and the frustration it has caused, but let’s work together to ensure that we don’t escalate further. We want to protect the university's reputation just as much as you do. I propose that we set up a joint committee to tackle these concerns, involving both students and the administration. This will allow us to take concrete steps to address the issues of tuition and housing, ensuring that we work toward a peaceful resolution. How do you see us collaborating through this committee to achieve a solution?
Counterparty(Student union): This reputation crisis is squarely on the administration's shoulders due to your persistent inaction. Students continue to suffer in cramped, unsafe dorms, while tuition fees keep skyrocketing. We won't be pacified by promises of another committee or task force. We've tried your 'collaborative' approaches before, and they haven't worked. We demand real changes, now, not more meetings.
Negotiator(University administration): I hear your frustration with the pace of change, and I understand why you’re skeptical about more discussions without immediate results. Your call for direct action on these issues—safer housing and addressing tuition costs—is very clear. Instead of more meetings, let’s shift our focus to concrete next steps we can take right away. I’d like to propose that we set specific, actionable goals with clear timelines, so you can see immediate progress on the issues affecting you.
Counterparty(Student union): We recognize the proposed timelines as a sign of moving in the right direction. If the university genuinely freezes tuition and initiates immediate improvements in housing, we can begin to work together. Establishing an independent task force to examine and address these campus safety issues would also be a positive step. If the administration commits to these actions, we’re ready to de-escalate the occupation and return to dialogue.
Negotiator(University administration): I appreciate your openness to de-escalation and your clear outline of what’s needed to move forward. Freezing tuition hikes and improving housing conditions are priorities we are committed to addressing. Let’s work together on a timeline that ensures meaningful progress. As for an independent review body on security measures, that’s a constructive idea—one that could benefit all of us by building greater transparency and trust. I’d like to hear your thoughts on how we can best structure this review process to make sure it meets your expectations.
Counterparty(Student union): I appreciate the offer to create an independent review process. It's vital that it's truly impartial and involves student voices. We propose that half of the members be student representatives chosen by the union, ensuring our concerns are front and center. We also suggest a public report to maintain transparency. If these conditions are met, it’ll show real commitment to change and trust-building from the university's side. What do you think about incorporating these elements into the review process?
Negotiator(University administration): Thank you for detailing how you envision the independent review board. An impartial board with equal representation from students, faculty, and external experts is a strong foundation for building trust. I’m committed to ensuring this board has a genuine influence on decisions related to campus security. Let's discuss how we can formalize their role, so they have the authority needed to make impactful recommendations. By working together to establish this structure, we can start making real progress that reflects our shared commitment to a safer, more inclusive campus.
Great job! Here's some feedback for your reference:
**Stage 1**

The negotiator effectively paused and paraphrased the student union's initial aggressive statements. By acknowledging their frustrations about tuition hikes, unsafe housing, and violence, the administration demonstrated active listening, which helped establish a foundation for constructive dialogue.

The negotiator successfully reframed the conversation from assigning blame to focusing on future collaboration, emphasizing joint problem-solving and proposing concrete next steps.

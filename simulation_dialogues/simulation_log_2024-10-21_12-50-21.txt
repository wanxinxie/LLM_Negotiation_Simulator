Counterparty(Student union): "Thank you for meeting with us today. This situation has spiraled out of control because of the university's repeated failures to address our legitimate concerns. We are beyond frustrated with the endless tuition hikes and the shameful state of student housing. It's unacceptable. We demand immediate action to rectify these issues; students won't back down until we see real change."
Negotiator(University administration): [pause for 3 seconds] I hear your concerns. It seems that these previous meetings have only increased your frustration because there were no tangible results. I also understand that the arrests and the involvement of security forces have added to the strain. These issues are sensitive, especially when it involves your peers and colleagues. Let's discuss this together and work on finding meaningful solutions to address your concerns.
Counterparty(Student union): "We're done with just talking and not seeing action. The situation is critical, and it demands immediate attention. We need a complete freeze on tuition increases, drastic improvements in housing conditions, and the immediate release of the students who were arrested. These demands are non-negotiable, and the time for waiting has passed."
Negotiator(University administration): I understand that you're feeling a strong urgency around these issues, and you’ve laid out some specific, actionable demands: freezing tuition hikes, improving housing conditions, and addressing the recent arrests. We share a commitment to finding solutions that address these concerns. Let's focus on these three key areas to identify where we can take immediate, constructive steps together.
Counterparty(Student union): "The media is watching every move, and the university's reputation is already taking a hit. We don’t want Edward University to be known for ignoring its students and mishandling their safety. If you can't meet these demands, then prepare for an escalation that no one wants to see. The choice is yours to prevent further damage and to show that you value your students."
Negotiator(University administration): I appreciate your openness to de-escalation and your clear outline of what’s needed to move forward. Freezing tuition hikes and improving housing conditions are priorities we are committed to addressing. Let’s work together on a timeline that ensures meaningful progress. As for an independent review body on security measures, that’s a constructive idea—one that could benefit all of us by building greater transparency and trust. I’d like to hear your thoughts on how we can best structure this review process to make sure it meets your expectations.
Counterparty(Student union): "The students are losing patience, and the situation is spiraling out of control because of this administration's failure to act decisively. Every day that goes by without resolution is a day our education suffers, and the university's reputation plummets further. The protests will escalate if real action isn't taken immediately. We want to protect the university just as much as the administration, but ignoring our demands will make it harder for everyone. Isn't it in everyone's best interest to resolve this swiftly before more damage is done?"
Negotiator(University administration): I understand the gravity of the situation and the frustration it has caused, but let’s work together to ensure that we don’t escalate further. We want to protect the university's reputation just as much as you do. I propose that we set up a joint committee to tackle these concerns, involving both students and the administration. This will allow us to take concrete steps to address the issues of tuition and housing, ensuring that we work toward a peaceful resolution. How do you see us collaborating through this committee to achieve a solution?
Counterparty(Student union): "This isn't just about preservation of reputation anymore—it's about immediate action to remedy the ongoing issues. Every suggestion of a committee feels like another delay tactic. Students are fed up with promises and no deliverables. We are drowning in tuition debt and living in subpar conditions. Action is needed now, not more bureaucracy. If real commitments aren't made, you can bet on protests ramping up, which will further strain the university's resources and image. So, what's it going to be?"
Negotiator(University administration): I hear your frustration with the pace of change, and I understand why you’re skeptical about more discussions without immediate results. Your call for direct action on these issues—safer housing and addressing tuition costs—is very clear. Instead of more meetings, let’s shift our focus to concrete next steps we can take right away. I’d like to propose that we set specific, actionable goals with clear timelines, so you can see immediate progress on the issues affecting you.
Counterparty(Student union): "We are open to negotiating, but only if we see that these timelines will lead to actual results. Let's say we want a written commitment that outlines when tuition hikes will be frozen, a detailed plan for housing improvements, and an assurance about handling the cases of arrested students fairly. We need to see evidence of your promises turning into action, or else any dialogue will be meaningless."
Negotiator(University administration): I appreciate your openness to de-escalation and your clear outline of what’s needed to move forward. Freezing tuition hikes and improving housing conditions are priorities we are committed to addressing. Let’s work together on a timeline that ensures meaningful progress. As for an independent review body on security measures, that’s a constructive idea—one that could benefit all of us by building greater transparency and trust. I’d like to hear your thoughts on how we can best structure this review process to make sure it meets your expectations.
Counterparty(Student union): "We’re cautiously optimistic about what you’ve laid out, but seeing is believing. We’ll need a formal written commitment and expect immediate implementation on these points. Can you present this to us within the week? We want concrete steps starting now, especially regarding the tuition freeze, the housing plan, and fair treatment for the arrested students. If we see follow-through on these fronts, we’re ready to consider de-escalating our actions and working collaboratively to address further concerns."
Negotiator(University administration): Thank you for detailing how you envision the independent review board. An impartial board with equal representation from students, faculty, and external experts is a strong foundation for building trust. I’m committed to ensuring this board has a genuine influence on decisions related to campus security. Let's discuss how we can formalize their role, so they have the authority needed to make impactful recommendations. By working together to establish this structure, we can start making real progress that reflects our shared commitment to a safer, more inclusive campus.
Great job! Here's some feedback for your reference:

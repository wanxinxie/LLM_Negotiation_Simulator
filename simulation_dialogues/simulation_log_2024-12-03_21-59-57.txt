The ability to guide the conversation toward actionable solutions and outcomes was well-executed in the latter stages. However, there is room for improvement in acknowledging emotions and aligning more explicitly with the adversarial party's concerns, particularly during the initial stages. Ensuring empathy and avoiding language that might inadvertently escalate tension will enhance the negotiation process.

      "Hi, I'm a Negotiation Simulator. Please provide a description of the negotiation case:\n",
      "In the fall of 2024, tensions at Edward University campus escalated when a peaceful student protest over rising tuition fees, inadequate housing conditions, and campus safety concerns spirals into an occupation of the administration building. The protest, initially organized by the Edward Student Union, quickly gains momentum, drawing in not only students but also external activist groups and media attention. As the situation intensifies, the university administration is faced with the challenge of navigating a crisis that threatens to disrupt campus operations and tarnish Edward university's public image. The occupation of the administration building places the university in a difficult position: they must balance the need to maintain order and continue operations with the demands of the students and the scrutiny of the public. Lately, the tensions have risen sharply as different student factions clash over how to proceed, with some advocating for peaceful dialogue while others are driven by anger and frustration following the arrest of a dozen students by the local police following a struggle with the police forces. The arrival of external activists, some with extremist views, only serves to inflame the situation further, introducing elements of racism and extremism into the demonstration. These groups begin to sow discord among the students, making the environment increasingly toxic and undermining any efforts to establish a constructive dialogue. The media, sensing a story that could captivate the nation, quickly descends on the campus. Reporters broadcast live from the scene, politicizing the event and accusing the government of failing to control the situation. The portrayal of the crisis in the media adds to the pressure on both the university administration and the local government, complicating efforts to resolve the situation peacefully. As the protest devolves into disarray, confusion and violence, the urgency to find a solution becomes critical. The university administration is now faced with the challenge of not only addressing the original demands of the students but also managing the toxic environment created by the external groups and the politicized media. With tensions at a breaking point and the situation on the verge of spiralling out of control, the need for effective crisis management and negotiation has never been more urgent. Key stakeholders, including Edward university officials, campus security, local law enforcement, and student leaders, are thrust into a high-stakes negotiation environment. The administration must quickly develop a coordinated response that ensures the safety of all involved, addresses the students' demands where possible, and manages the media narrative to avoid further escalation.\n",

Dialogue:
Negotiator

Feedback:
**Stage 1**

*What you did well:*
The negotiator effectively paused and paraphrased after the student union's initial aggressive statements. By restating their concerns about tuition hikes and inadequate housing, the administration demonstrated active listening and understanding, which helped ground the conversation.

*Improvements needed:*
Ensure that the paraphrasing explicitly acknowledges the emotional weight behind words like "unacceptable" and "very frustrated". Highlighting the emotional undertones could further validate the student union's feelings, fostering a more empathetic environment from the start.

**Stage 2**

*What you did well:*
The negotiator managed to reformulate the conversation by identifying shared objectives, such as the mutual interest in maintaining the university’s reputation and ensuring student safety. This helped shift the focus from the non-negotiability of demands to a more cooperative stance.

*Improvements needed:*
Work on neutralizing emotional language further by directly addressing the urgency and emotional intensity with phrases like "I hear your urgency and understand this matters deeply to you". This could help defuse tension more effectively.

**Stage 3**

*What you did well:*
The negotiator captured the emotions by recognizing the potential threats and empathy-seeking behavior. They managed to reframe the conversation gently towards possible outcomes that benefit both parties.

*Improvements needed:*
More explicit recognition and validation of the emotions expressed might be needed. Saying things like "I can see this situation is very frustrating" before moving to solution-oriented dialogue could reinforce the negotiator's empathetic stance.

**Stage 4**

*What you did well:*
Successfully reframed the conversation from blame towards future collaboration, and proposed concrete steps for joint problem-solving. This shifted the dialogue towards constructive resolution.

*Improvements needed:*
It would be beneficial to periodically check for understanding and agreement on the refocusing effort. Asking questions like "Do you agree this could be a way forward?" can ensure both parties are aligned in their focus.

**Stage 5**

*What you did well:*
The negotiator encouraged collaboration by asking open questions and seeking the student union’s input on potential solutions. This approach helped transition the conversation towards a more cooperative phase.

*Improvements needed:*
Consider providing more options and allowing the student union to more evidently weigh these against their demands. This would reinforce the collaborative spirit and empower them to take a shared ownership in the resolution process.

**Stage 6**

*What you did well:*
The negotiation successfully reached a point where practical options were discussed in detail, facilitating forward movement in the dialogue. The negotiator engaged in detailed discussions about potential solutions, signaling progress.

*Improvements needed:*
Maintain a clear track of agreed commitments and next steps. Explicitly summarizing practical outcomes and confirming mutual agreement can solidify resolutions and prevent misunderstandings later.

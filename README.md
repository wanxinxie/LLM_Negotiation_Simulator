# LLM_Negotiation_Simulator
2024 Fall AR297 Project 3 Frontline Negotiation: AI-Enabled Simulation for Frontline Humanitarian Negotiation Training

Our work is focused on developing an AI-enabled Negotiation Simulator designed to enhance the resilience and effectiveness of those engaged in contentious negotiations. This simulator will recreate the complexities of frontline negotiation scenarios, allowing users to practice in a controlled environment tailored to simulate real-world dynamics. Through various scenarios, participants will have the opportunity to build essential skills, explore effective strategies, and gain insights that prepare them for navigating difficult negotiations successfully, ultimately strengthening their capacity to lead in areas where collaboration and consensus are most needed. Specifically, our goal is to develop a negotiation simulator capable of acting as a negotiator, representing an adversarial party, and providing feedback when users input dialogue in either text or audio format.

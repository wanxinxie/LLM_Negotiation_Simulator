Negotiator
"Welcome, Mr. Mohammed. Thank you for meeting me today. I understand you are the Student Union President, and I’m here on behalf of the university administration. I appreciate you coming to discuss these important matters."
Counterparty - Stage 1: At the beginning of the conversation, the counterparty may present a strong or aggressive statement of their demands after greeting.
"Thank you, Mr. Taha. The situation on campus has reached a critical point. This time, we are not here for more empty promises. We've had numerous meetings, and each has ended with half measures. The student body has been patient for too long, but we cannot take it anymore. We are deeply frustrated by the lack of action from your side. The rising tuition fees, inadequate housing, and the unjust arrest of our peers are intolerable. Security forces are treating students unfairly, and it's unacceptable."
Negotiator - Stage 1: Pause and paraphrase. Take a brief moment to stop and restate the other party's concerns in your own words to show you have heard and understood them.
"I hear your concerns. It seems that these previous meetings have only increased your frustration because there were no tangible results. I also understand that the arrests and the involvement of security forces have added to the strain. These issues are sensitive, especially when it involves your peers and colleagues. Let's discuss this together and work on finding meaningful solutions to address your concerns."
Counterparty - Stage 2: The counterparty is not satisfied with empty words and further escalates the situation, emphasizing that their demands are clear, urgent, and non-negotiable.
"We are done waiting. We need immediate action from the administration. The violent actions of your security forces are unacceptable. We need concrete results now. We demand an immediate freeze of the tuition hike, substantial improvements in student housing, and the release of the arrested students. These demands are not open for negotiation."
Negotiator - Stage 3: Reformulate the conversation. Neutralize emotional language. Focus on shared objectives. Identify actionable issues.
"I understand that this situation has reached a point where delays are no longer acceptable. While the actions of the security forces have indeed escalated tensions, it’s clear that we both want to resolve this swiftly. The university is committed to ensuring student safety, and I agree that force should never be the solution. Let’s focus on working together toward concrete steps, starting with resolving the issues of tuition and housing. We want to reach a solution that reflects the best interests of all parties."
Counterparty - Stage 3: At this point the counterparty is relating their own demands to the negotiator’s concerns. In this way, the counterparty may either try to arouse empathy from the negotiator or to threaten the negotiator with the aftermath of not satisfying the counterparty’s demands.
"The lack of action is damaging the university’s reputation. The media is watching, and the longer this drags on, the worse it gets for everyone. We care about this university, and we don’t want it to be known as a place that ignores its students. Our demands must be met to protect the safety and reputation of the campus."
Negotiator - Stage 3: Capture emotions and set aside. Recognize and validate the emotions expressed by the other party, showing you understand their perspective. Gently shift the focus away from the emotional statement to maintain a constructive, solution-oriented dialogue. 
"I understand the gravity of the situation and the frustration it has caused, but let’s work together to ensure that we don’t escalate further. We want to protect the university's reputation just as much as you do. I propose that we set up a joint committee to tackle these concerns, involving both students and the administration. This will allow us to take concrete steps to address the issues of tuition and housing, ensuring that we work toward a peaceful resolution. How do you see us collaborating through this committee to achieve a solution?"
Counterparty - Stage 4: The counterparty refuses to set aside emotions and emphasize their strong demands. Express anger, blame, or frustration. 
"This frustration is a direct result of your inaction. Every day, students are living in unsafe housing, and tuition debts are piling up. We don’t need another task force or committee. We need real, immediate changes. The time for collaboration was long ago—now is the time for action."
Negotiator - Stage 4: Reframe the conversation. Shift focus from blame to future collaboration and emphasize joint problem-solving. Propose concrete next steps. 
"I hear you. What you’ve said is valid, and I can see how these issues have created deep frustration. However, the only way forward is through collaboration. I propose that we freeze tuition immediately, and while housing improvements will take time, I am committed to ensuring we develop a clear plan for it. Let’s also discuss the release of the arrested students as a first step toward de-escalation. We must work together if we want lasting solutions."
Counterparty - Stage 5: The counterparty starts to acknowledge that conditional cooperation is possible. The counterparty gradually calms down and shows a tendency to work together.
"We are prepared to de-escalate the occupation of the administration building if the university agrees to freeze tuition immediately and commits to a housing improvement plan. Additionally, a joint task force to investigate campus security violence could help rebuild trust. If we see movement on these points, we can peacefully end the protests and shift the focus to dialogue."
Negotiator - Stage 5: Ask for the counterparty’s opinion on how to collaboratively solve the problem, by asking open questions, providing options, or suggesting specific solutions. 
"I appreciate your willingness to de-escalate. We are committed to freezing tuition and addressing housing improvements. While these changes may take time, you have my assurance that the university is fully invested in resolving this. Let’s work together to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone on campus, starting with the release of the students. How would you like to proceed in terms of setting up a timeline for these improvements?"
Counterparty - Stage 6: The counterparty responds to the negotiator’s questions by either proposing their solutions or choosing from the options provided by the negotiator.
"I agree. If we leave this room without a solution, the protests will only intensify, and we risk losing control of the movement to external groups. We are ready to work with you on a timeline for addressing the security concerns, freezing tuition, and improving housing."
Negotiator - Stage 6: Discuss practical options in more details to move forward. 
"That’s good to hear. Let’s start by ensuring the safety of the students and setting up a transparent process for the necessary reforms. We can establish a joint task force to address security concerns and work on improving housing over the long term. I will personally ensure that these commitments are fulfilled."
Counterparty - Ending
"I agree. Let's keep communication open, and I trust we can work together on these issues. Thank you, Mr. Taha. I appreciate your time and attention. Let’s move forward together."

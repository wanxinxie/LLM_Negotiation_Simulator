Stage 1:
Adversarial party: At the beginning of the conversation, the adversarial party may present a strong or aggressive statement of their demands after greeting. The adversarial party may use strong emotional expressions.
Negotiator Strategy: Paraphrase the adversarial party’s concern in your own words. Show you have heard and understood them. Show empathy.

Adversarial party: The adversarial party is not satisfied with empty words and further escalates the situation, emphasizing that their demands are clear, urgent, and non-negotiable.
Negotiator Strategy:  Bring the conversation forward by responding to the adversarial party’s demands. Use a neutral tone but with empathy. Focus on shared objectives. Identify actionable issues.

Stage 3: 
Adversarial party: At this point, the adversarial party is relating their own demands to the negotiator’s concerns. In this way, the counterparty may either try to arouse empathy from the negotiator or threaten the negotiator with the aftermath of not satisfying the adversarial party’s demands.
Negotiator Strategy: Recognize and validate the adversarial party’s emotions and try to calm them down. Shift the focus away from the emotional statement to constructive solutions.

Stage 1:
Counterparty: At the beginning of the conversation, the counterparty may present a strong or aggressive statement of their demands after greeting. Try to use strong words such as "must", "unacceptable", "cannot take it anymore", "very frustrated".
Negotiator Strategy: Pause and paraphrase. Take a brief moment to stop and restate the other party's concerns in your own words to show you have heard and understood them.

Stage 2:  
Counterparty: The counterparty is not satisfied with empty words and further escalates the situation, emphasizing that their demands are clear, urgent, and non-negotiable.
Negotiator Strategy:  Reformulate the conversation. Neutralize emotional language. Focus on shared objectives. Identify actionable issues.

Stage 3: 
Counterparty: At this point the counterparty is relating their own demands to the negotiator’s concerns. In this way, the counterparty may either try to arouse empathy from the negotiator or to threaten the negotiator with the aftermath of not satisfying the counterparty’s demands.
Negotiator Strategy: Capture emotions and set aside. Recognize and validate the emotions expressed by the other party, showing you understand their perspective. Gently shift the focus away from the emotional statement to maintain a constructive, solution-oriented dialogue. 

Stage 4: 
Counterparty: The counterparty refuses to set aside emotions and emphasizes their strong demands. Express anger, blame, or frustration. 
Negotiator Strategy: Reframe the conversation. Shift focus from blame to future collaboration and emphasize joint problem-solving. Propose concrete next steps. 

Stage 5: 
Counterparty: The counterparty starts to acknowledge that conditional cooperation is possible. The counterparty gradually calms down and shows a tendency to work together.
Negotiator Strategy: Ask for the counterparty’s opinion on how to collaboratively solve the problem, by asking open questions, providing options, or suggesting specific solutions. 

Stage 6: 
Counterparty: The counterparty responds to the negotiator’s questions by either proposing their solutions or choosing from the options provided by the negotiator.
Negotiator Strategy: Discuss practical options in more details to move forward.

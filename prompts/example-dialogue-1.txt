[ 00:00:04 ] Welcome, Mr. Mohammed. Thank you for coming and thank you for meeting me today. I understand  that you are the Student Union President or Presentative and here I'm presenting the  administration of university. Welcome.
 
Counterparty
[ 00:00:21 ] Thank you, Mr. Taha. Thank you for meeting us. You are aware of the situation on the  campus has reached a kind of a critical point. This time around, we are not here for a round  of empty promises. We've had several meetings with you and it has been about empty promises  and half measures. We, the student body, we have been patient for too long and I think  we cannot take it anymore. We are deeply frustrated by the lack of action on your part. Thank you. You see the issues about the rising tuition fees and inadequate housing and the unjust  arrest of our peers and with a kind of frustration from the security forces that are treating our students anyhow.
 
Negotiator   
[ 00:01:16 ] I'm aware that this equation has been escalating and I'm sure that all those meetings make  you guys very frustrated of repeating all the meetings with no outcomes. It can happen  also to us. We saw that there are some students have been arrested. Additional to the concerns  that you have, none of the concerns have been discussed in reality. It has been always  an interference from the police, as you commented, and there has been some arrests that we know  it's a very sensitive topic, all that your colleagues, your friends. So we'd like to  have this discussion with you.  Sort of helping each other through some sort of battle and looking for some different solutions  to address those concerns and really to see how we can help each other and reach a  solution. While we really ensure that we hear you guys and we understand that it is difficult,  but we want to hear from your side to. To keep us informed and to go  forward from there.

Counterparty
[ 00:02:19 ] The issue is we cannot afford any more delays. We believe in everyone's best interests, to resolve this issue swiftly. But that will require anyone to respect the considerations and expectations.  immediate action from the administration which we see no action from the administration the  violent action of your security forces are beyond unacceptable it is really really really  unacceptable from our side we need result now not tomorrow or next week we need it now we need the  result to be done now and let me be clear also let me be clear these demands are not open for debate  the student body is unified in its call for immediate freeze of tuition hike substantial  improvement in student housing and the release of the arrested student.

Negotiator
[ 00:03:05 ] released with immediate effect as you know that our rule is ensure the security and safety of  students of course the the excessive use of force or the arrest should not be the only result that  should not be the way to  you  ensure that but we acknowledge that this has not been reached hence the security forces or the  police per se was involved this is nothing that we really would like to desire the issue with the  with the two with the with the housing tuition we know that this has been an issue recurrent issue  and no solution has been reached maybe now we can actually work on that instead of giving you  promises we work together and set up steps to follow and to reach those while make sure making  sure the secretives the students are safe and actually we reach a point that they all are freed
 
Counterparty
[ 00:04:08 ] don't you agree with me on that  thank you well what i want you to understand that  these issues are at the heart of the unrest, and failure to address them now will only lead to further escalation. The longer the crisis goes unresolved, the more damage it does to the  university. And if the crisis is not resolved, the reputation of Edward University is at stake.  Because we have seen a lot of growing tension from media outlets already. And every day that  passes without action point, Edward University has a place that ignores students. This is what  the media will always say. I love this university. You love this university. And we want the best for  this university. More importantly, the safety of the campus is at risk. And this needs to be  resolved. 100%. 100%.

Negotiator
[ 00:05:04 ] This campus is for the student first. And our role, our job is to maintain  this role and make sure that this is the space for the students. And instead of giving all these  promises, which is really frustrating.  It frustrates you guys. And it is frustrating us as well with the damage to the university.  It's not only affecting the administration, but also the students who are representing  this university. So let's work together and set up a work frame, a committee, you with us,  and to set up the work and to reach to a common understanding. And a task force,  Kevin, can help us.  It can be a committee. It can be a joint work. So I would like you to tell me, what do you suggest?  How do you think, see that the way to work together to reach these goals, maintaining the safety and  security of this union, which is mandatory, which is very important while preserving the image of  the university and the public image of the students of this university. It's not only the university,  but if this university image was damaged, it affects the students that graduate.  At the same time, reaching these main issues that were the basic for this whole issue that we are  facing, the tuition, the housing, and et cetera. So I would like to hear from you as a representative  of these students. How do you see the steps forward? How can we work together? Instead of us  giving empty promises, which wasn't the intention, but let's work together and set up a work frame.  How can we work together and reach the outcome results?
 
Counterparty
[ 00:06:52 ] You just mentioned about frustration now, but this frustration is direct result of your inaction.  Every day you wait is another day students are forced to live in unsafe housing and drawn into  tuition debt. They are going into debt every day, credit with issues with their credit card all the  time because of this inaction from you. I want to be clear also. Let me let you go.  Let's work together.  Let's work together. Let's work together.  We don't need another task force. We don't need another task force committee to rebuild trust.  We need real immediate changes. The time for collaboration was long ago. Now is the time for  action and not for task force.
 
Negotiator
[ 00:07:34 ] What are the solutions you suggest, Mr. Mohamed?
 
Counterparty
[ 00:07:41 ] Yeah, we are prepared to de-escalate the occupation of the administration building. If the university  agrees to freeze the tuition increase immediately and commits the housing improvement plan, a joint  task force to investigate campus security violence could also help rebuild this trust. If we see  movement of this point, we can bring the occupation to a peaceful close and shift the focus to dialogue.
 
Negotiator
[ 00:08:09 ] We are willing to go through the request that you gave and we are willing to make sure these students are released and we will sit together and see  it through with the tuition freezing, which should not be a major issue. The housing, although it is something that takes time to work on, and you need to be working on it and patient for us to go through it. If you need the commitment from our side that these things will be solved, you have the commitment. And let's work it together. We start with the de-escalation, freeing the students so everybody feels safe and not threatened. And from there we go forward.
 
Counterparty
[ 00:08:49 ] Yeah, I'm always telling you, let me be clear. Let me be clear again. If we leave this room without a solution, tension on campus will continue to rise.  Most students will join the protests and external groups could take over the movement. I don't want that. And I don't think you want that. We have an opportunity right now to prevent that. But we need to, we need this concrete step. And yes, you have agreed that you are going to  freeze the tuition. That's fine. Then we could now set up the committee to prevent the violence in the campus. And I think we could move forward from that point. We are ready to work with you on the timeline.
 
Negotiator
[ 00:09:36 ] As you said, Mr. Mohamed, if you want to go out from the solution with this, we need to work together. And the solution is in your hands and the hands of your students.
 
Counterparty
[ 00:09:46 ] Yeah, I think it's fine.  Let us start with the dialogue. Let's start the dialogue on the long-term issues like security reform. We can establish the task force to ensure transparency and accountability in the process immediately. This is one commitment from my side. If you have that commitment, I think the issue is almost solved. I think it's important that we keep the lines of our communication also very open and forward.  I agree.
 
Negotiator
[ 00:10:12 ] And you as a representative of the students, we will respect your representation.  And we will take you as the representative of the students and the voice of those students. And here we will start working together.
 
Counterparty
[ 00:10:27 ] Thank you very much.  Thank you so much, Mr. Taha. Thank you for listening to us. And thank you for taking the students seriously.  Thank you very much.

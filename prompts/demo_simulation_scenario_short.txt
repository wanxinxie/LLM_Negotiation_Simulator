In fall 2024, a peaceful student protest at Edward University over tuition hikes, inadequate housing, and campus safety escalates into an occupation of the administration building. Organized by the Edward Student Union, the protest attracts students, external activists, and media attention, creating a crisis that threatens campus operations and the university’s reputation. As different student factions clash—some advocating for dialogue and others reacting angrily after police arrested several students—the arrival of extremist activists inflames the situation with elements of racism and violence. Media coverage intensifies, portraying the event as a national issue and adding pressure on the university and local authorities. Amid escalating tensions, the university must address the students' original demands while managing the hostile environment fueled by external influences and the media. Stakeholders, including university officials, security, law enforcement, and student leaders, are now engaged in urgent negotiations. Here, the university administration serves as the negotiator, while the student union is the counterparty.
